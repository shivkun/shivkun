## FAQ:

**Q: Why don‚Äôt you have any projects here?**  
A: Because modern programming cured me of joy.

**Q: Wait, what happened?**  
A: Imagine trying to build a house, but every brick is from a different country, labeled in a language no one speaks, and the instruction manual just says ‚ÄúGood luck üíÖ.‚Äù

**Q: There‚Äôs so much free info online!**  
A: Free? You mean the $599 ‚ÄúUltimate Junior Dev MegaCourse‚Äù that ends with ‚ÄúSet up a portfolio and pray‚Äù?  
Yeah. Free.

**Q: What about the community?**  
A: It‚Äôs amazing. Especially if you love sarcasm, superiority complexes, and being told ‚Äújust read the docs‚Äù when the docs are literally a broken link to an empty page.

**Q: So are you done coding forever?**  
A: Let‚Äôs call it a trial separation. If programming decides to work on itself, maybe we‚Äôll talk.  
Until then, I‚Äôm seeing other hobbies.
